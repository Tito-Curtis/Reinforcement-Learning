# âš¡ HESS-RL: Hybrid Energy Storage System with Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a **Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS)** for microgrid energy management using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**.  
The goal is to optimize the interaction between **battery storage** and **supercapacitors**, reducing grid imports and minimizing operational costs, while comparing performance with a **rule-based baseline controller**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Custom **Gymnasium environment** for HESS microgrid.
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** implementation in PyTorch.
- **Replay buffer** for stable training.
- **Rule-based controller (RBC)** for baseline comparison.
- Evaluation plots:  
  - Battery & Supercapacitor SOC  
  - Load vs Renewable vs Grid Import  
  - Electricity Price  
  - Agent Actions  
  - Reward Accumulation
